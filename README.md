# Netflix Data Analysis & Insights 📺🔥

## Overview
This project dives deep into Netflix’s public dataset to uncover binge-worthy trends and hidden stories behind the content on the platform. Using Python's pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn, I cleaned, explored, and visualized the data to reveal patterns in genres, countries producing content, movie durations, and content types.

This hands-on project helped me sharpen my data analysis and visualization skills, perfect for leveling up as a data engineer and data scientist.

## Dataset
The dataset was sourced from [Netflix Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/netflix-shows)  
It contains **~6,000** records with **12+ features** including title, type (Movie/TV Show), genre, country, duration, and rating.

## Project Workflow
- **Day 1–3:** Data loading, cleaning, and preliminary exploration  
- **Day 4–5:** Created visualizations like histograms and bar charts to analyze movie durations, content types, and ratings  
- **Day 6:** Extracted key insights highlighting top genres, top producing countries, and content type distributions  

## Key Insights 🔍
- 🎭 **Drama** is the most common genre on Netflix, showing a clear demand for emotionally engaging content.  
- 🇺🇸 The **United States** leads content production, followed by **India** and the **United Kingdom**.  
- 🎬 **Movies** make up the majority of Netflix’s content compared to TV shows.  
- ⏱️ Most movies run between **80-100 minutes**, with some unique outliers on both ends.
- The histogram reveals that most Netflix movies are feature-length, clustering around 90–100 minutes, with the   majority between 80–120 minutes. While short films (<60 mins) and very long films (>150 mins) exist, they form a small part of the catalog, reflecting Netflix's focus on standard-length movies to align with viewer attention spans.

## Tools & Libraries 🛠️
- Python (pandas, numpy)  
- Matplotlib & Seaborn for visualization  
- Jupyter Notebook for development  
- Git & GitHub for version control and project management

## How to Run 🚀
1. Clone the repository:  
   `git clone https://github.com/anjali0906vinod/netflix_analysis.git`  
2. Navigate into the folder:  
   `cd netflix_analysis`  
3. Install required libraries (if you haven’t already):  
   `pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn`  
4. Open and run the notebook:  
   `jupyter notebook day_6_insights_extraction.ipynb`

## Future Work 🔮
- Integrate SQL queries for deeper data engineering practice  
- Perform sentiment analysis on user reviews or comments  
- Build a recommendation system based on content features
